### Title:
**Comparative Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) Alone vs. SRP Combined with Systemic and/or Local Azithromycin in the Management of Clinical Attachment Loss**

### Abstract:
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) alone versus SRP combined with systemic and/or local azithromycin on clinical attachment loss (CAL) in patients with chronic periodontitis. Periodontitis is a progressive inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting structures, leading to CAL. Azithromycin, an antibiotic with both systemic and local applications, has been suggested as an adjunct to SRP to enhance periodontal healing. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare four groups: SRP alone, SRP plus systemic azithromycin, SRP plus local azithromycin, and SRP plus both systemic and local azithromycin. The primary outcome will be the reduction in clinical attachment loss and periodontal probing depth (PPD) over a 3-month follow-up. This research will contribute to the optimization of periodontal treatment protocols and may identify the most effective adjunctive therapy for clinical attachment preservation.

### Rationale:
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to progressive destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, ultimately resulting in clinical attachment loss (CAL) and, if untreated, tooth loss. The gold standard treatment for periodontitis is Scaling and Root Planing (SRP), which aims to mechanically remove plaque and calculus from root surfaces to reduce inflammation. However, SRP alone may not be sufficient in eradicating pathogenic bacteria, especially in deeper periodontal pockets, resulting in bacterial recolonization, persistent inflammation, and continued attachment loss.

Adjunctive antimicrobial therapies, particularly antibiotics, have been explored to enhance SRP outcomes. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has gained attention due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and its ability to concentrate in periodontal tissues. Systemic azithromycin has been shown to improve periodontal health by reducing bacterial load and modulating host immune responses, while local applications of azithromycin can deliver high concentrations directly to periodontal pockets, minimizing systemic side effects and enhancing localized bacterial clearance.

However, current research has limitations:

1. **Lack of Comparative Data**: While both systemic and local azithromycin have been individually studied, few studies have directly compared their effectiveness or investigated their combined use.
2. **Variable Outcomes**: Studies on adjunctive antibiotics have reported inconsistent results, with some showing significant CAL improvements and others showing minimal benefit beyond SRP alone.
3. **Antibiotic Resistance Concerns**: Overuse of systemic antibiotics can promote resistance. Combining systemic and local antibiotics may reduce the required systemic dosage while maintaining efficacy.
4. **Patient-Specific Response Variability**: Responses to adjunctive treatments vary, and there is no consensus on which patient groups benefit most from systemic or local antibiotic therapy.

### Motivation for the Study:
This study is motivated by the need to address these limitations and provide a more definitive understanding of how adjunctive azithromycin (both systemic and local) affects clinical attachment loss and periodontal outcomes. The study will investigate whether combining systemic and local azithromycin with SRP offers better clinical outcomes than SRP alone or SRP combined with only one form of azithromycin. This research aims to fill existing gaps, optimize the use of antibiotics in periodontal therapy, and reduce antibiotic resistance risks while improving long-term periodontal health.

### Research Question:
What is the comparative effectiveness of SRP alone, SRP combined with systemic azithromycin, SRP combined with local azithromycin, and SRP combined with both systemic and local azithromycin in reducing clinical attachment loss in patients with chronic periodontitis?

### Objectives:
#### Primary Objective:
To evaluate and compare the impact of SRP alone, SRP with systemic azithromycin, SRP with local azithromycin, and SRP with both systemic and local azithromycin on clinical attachment loss in patients with chronic periodontitis.

#### Secondary Objectives:
- To assess the reduction in periodontal probing depth (PPD) in each treatment group.
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of systemic and local azithromycin as adjuncts to SRP.
- To compare the plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) among the treatment groups.
- To determine if the combination of systemic and local azithromycin provides additional benefits over using either form alone.

### Methodology:
#### Study Design:
- **Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- **Participants**: 120 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.

#### Inclusion Criteria:
- Adults aged 18–65 years.
- Diagnosed with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (clinical attachment loss ≥3mm).

#### Exclusion Criteria:
- Systemic antibiotic therapy within the last 6 months.
- Smoking or history of systemic diseases affecting periodontal health.
- Pregnant and lactating patients.
- Patients with systemic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or immunodeficiency disorders.
- Patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or a history of stroke.

#### Study Groups:
- **Group A (Control)**: SRP alone.
- **Group B**: SRP + systemic azithromycin (500 mg for 3 days).
- **Group C**: SRP + local azithromycin (0.5% gel applied locally).
- **Group D**: SRP + systemic azithromycin (500 mg for 3 days) + local azithromycin (0.5% gel applied locally).

#### Treatment Protocol:
- **Scaling and Root Planing (SRP)**: Standard procedure performed in all groups.
- **Systemic Azithromycin**: 500 mg oral azithromycin for 3 consecutive days post-SRP.
- **Local Azithromycin**: 0.5% azithromycin gel applied topically in periodontal pockets during SRP and at follow-up visits.

#### Outcome Measures:
- **Primary Outcome**: Change in clinical attachment level (CAL) at baseline and 3-month follow-up.
- **Secondary Outcomes**:
  - Periodontal probing depth (PPD).
  - Plaque index (PI).
  - Gingival index (GI).

### Statistical Analysis:
- Data will be analyzed using statistical software (e.g., SPSS).
- Continuous variables (CAL, PPD) will be expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using ANOVA or t-tests.
- A p-value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

### Conclusion:
This study aims to identify whether the adjunctive use of systemic and/or local azithromycin with SRP can improve clinical attachment preservation in patients with periodontitis. The findings will contribute to the development of optimized periodontal treatment protocols and provide evidence on the most effective treatment strategy for managing clinical attachment loss. Additionally, it will help address the concern of antibiotic resistance while optimizing clinical outcomes.
